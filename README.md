This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

This Repository contains all the code for my Ludum Dare 38 Project Star-Crossed. 

Star-Crossed is a 2D Circular Platformer where the player must traverse across different planets, and through space to rescue his girlfriend from a cannibal alien.

As this was a game that was made in 72 hours the code is not extremely well commented, but everything works properly and should be fairly easy to understand.

Star-Crossed can be played at https://titomakanijr.itch.io/star-crossed
